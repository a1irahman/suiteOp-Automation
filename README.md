# SuiteOpAutomation

This project was created to implement SuiteOP’s coding challenge. This implementation uses Angular to create a basic MVP of an automation software that allows hotels to manage their guests’ experience. Due to the limited time available to develop this project, I used a combination of hand coding and low/no-code techniques. This allowed me to flesh out this project within the given time constraint. Leveraging these tools allowed me to prototype at a much greater speed, and allowed a greater depth of feature development in the allotted time. There are many optimizations that can be made if this were going into production and went through a complete development cycle, including automated/unit testing.
